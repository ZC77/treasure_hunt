OK this is my prototype of using react native and leaflet to make a map.
I have used react native and GPS stuff before so hopefully I can remember enough
and use the tutorial and docs to get a map displayed.

to setup:

get the git repository: in vscode go ctrl shift p, and type git clone

run "npm install"

run "expo start"

download the expo app to your phone

scan the qr code
