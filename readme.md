# Subject of a Treasure Hunt - prototype #

*COMPX241 - "Smoke & Mirrors" project*

### Introduction ###
'The subject of a treasure hunt' is a mobile app designed to help new students learn about the facilities and resources provided by the university. 
Through the use of location and mapping, the app aims to serve students with riddles relevant to their degree, which can then be solved by exploring specific locations containing the answer.
Utilising an achievement based reward system, participants are motivated to answer more riddles by exploring each location throughly. 

By bringing an objective to campus orientation, riddles can prompt students to explore the campus and learn important information in the process. Our implementation of riddles in a location-aware context aims to provide students with an app they can use on campus in their own time, with potential for the university to expand later down the road.
